  <p>The COAL final report with code and digital artifacts was submitted at the end of the term, completing the 2016&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;2017 senior capstone project. The hard copy of the printed report is on file with the OSU School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science where it may be shared with students and industry sponsors. This blog post describes how to obtain digital copies of the report and associated files.</p>

  <p>The entire COAL final report submission including all documents, code, and digital artifacts is hosted on Box for Oregon State University. The <a href="https://oregonstate.box.com/s/caaavrxblinttcyoj7qpjyjb7jyztbtv">archive</a> is in <code>tar.bz2</code> format and is 8.8GB in size. Enclosed within the archive is a <code>README</code> which summarizes the locations of important resources such as documents, presentations, and requisite files.</p>

  <p>The San Juan Mine case study QGIS project and files can be downloaded separately from Google Drive. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxysdOuBmaIGX0JucjlUZ0d4cGc">archive</a> is in <code>tar.gz</code> format and is 2GB in size (7GB uncompressed). It contains visible-light, mining classified, and environmental correlation imagery as well as mine permit, hydrography, elevation, and transportation data. Extract the archive and open the project file <code>san&#8209;juan&#8209;mine.qgs</code> with a <a href="/docs#qgis">build of QGIS</a> linked against GDAL 2.2.0+.</p>

  <p>Contact the COAL <a href="/team">team</a> with any questions about accessing the data.</p>
