  <p>COAL was recently awarded an <a href="https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/startup">XSEDE Startup Allocation</a> which will be used to continue application development by the team. In addition, we will be looking to undertake benchmarking, evaluation and experimentation on the various XSEDE resources. The availability and opportunity to use  computational infrastructure of this calibre will further enable the development of a science gateway to continue foundational COAL research.</p>

  <p>Specifically the allocation details are as follows</p>
  <ul>
    <li>PI: Lewis McGibbney, NASA JPL</li>
    <li>Co-I's: Taylor Alexander Brown, Heidi Ann Clayton and Xiaomei Wang of OSU</li>
    <li>Request: Coal and Open-pit surface mining impacts on American Lands (COAL)</li>
    <li>Request Number: EAR170010 (New)</li>
    <li>Start Date: N/A</li>
    <li>End Date: 2018-05-21</li>
    <li>Awarded Resources: PSC Large Memory (Bridges Large): 1,000.0 SUs PSC Storage (Bridges Pylon): 2,000.0 GB</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The estimated value of these awarded resources is $732.00. The allocation of these resources represents a considerable investment by the NSF in advanced computing infrastructure for U.S. The dollar value of the COAL allocation is estimated from the NSF awards supporting the allocated resources.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking we are extermely happy to be in receipt of such an award. It is our aim and intention to publish the progress we make in a series of conference, workshop and journal activities... so watch this space!</p>
