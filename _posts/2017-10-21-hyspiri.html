  <p>COAL was presented to attendees of the <a href="https://hyspiri.jpl.nasa.gov/events/2017-hyspiri-science-team-meeting">2017 HyspIRI Science and Applications Workshop</a> which took place at the California Institute of Technology, Beckman Institute Auditorium, 1200 E California Blvd Pasadena, CA 91125 from Oct 17th - 19th. COAL was presented alongside a huge variety of outstanding work in the area of Global Earth Imaging Spectroscopy and Thermal Infrared Measurements.</p>

  <p>The workshop was focused on everything related to the NASA Decadal Survey Mission Concept named <a href="https://hyspiri.jpl.nasa.gov">HyspIRI</a>; Hyperspectral Infrared Imager. HyspIRI will study the worldâ€™s ecosystems and provide critical information on natural disasters such as volcanoes, wildfires and drought. HyspIRI will be able to identify the type of vegetation that is present and whether the vegetation is healthy. The mission will provide a benchmark on the state of the worlds ecosystems against which future changes can be assessed. The mission will also assess the pre-eruptive behavior of volcanoes and the likelihood of future eruptions as well as the carbon and other gases released from wildfires.</p>

  <p>The HyspIRI mission includes two instruments mounted on a satellite in Low Earth Orbit. There is an imaging spectrometer measuring from the visible to short wave infrared (VSWIR: 380 nm - 2500 nm) in 10 nm contiguous bands and a multispectral imager measuring from 3 to 12 um in the mid and thermal infrared (TIR). The VSWIR and TIR instruments both have a spatial resolution of 60 m at nadir. The VSWIR will have a revisit of of 19 days and the TIR will have a revisit of 5 days. HyspIRI also includes an Intelligent Payload Module (IPM) which will enable direct broadcast of a subset of the data.</p>

  <p>The data from HyspIRI will be used for a wide variety of studies primarily in the Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem and Earth Surface and Interior focus areas. The mission was recommended in the 2007 National Research Council Decadal Survey requested by NASA, NOAA, and USGS.The mission is currently at the study stage and this website is being provided as a focal point for information on the mission and to keep the community informed on the mission activities.</p>

  <p>We intend to extend COAL to accomodate data from HyspIRI once it is available. In the meantime we look forward to continued work and collaborations with members of the Global Earth Imaging Spectroscopy and Thermal Infrared Measurements community. The COAL poster presented at the HyspIRI Workshop can be downloaded from our <a href="./publications.html">publications page</a>.</p>
