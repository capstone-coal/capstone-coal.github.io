  <p>We we absolutely stoked to receive excellent news that the <a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/capstone/submission/?page=preview&pid=320" class="external">COAL Follow-On (COAL-FO) project proposal</a> was accepted by Oregon State Universities Senior Capstone program. This will enable us to continue critical work into COAL software development, research and utilization of the XSEDE Startup resources we have available.</p>

  <p>We are very happy to welcome Kenneth Bertino Thompson and Bryce Egley, our new Senior Computer Scientists from OSU's College for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science to the COAL team. The 2017-2018 project is the successor project to the 2016-2017 COAL project. COAL initially aimed to deliver a suite of algorithms to identify, classify, characterize, and quantify (by reporting a number of key metrics) the direct and indirect impacts of mining operations and related destructive surface mining activities across the continental U.S (and further afield). COAL successfully delivered a Python library for processing hyperspectral imagery from remote sensing devices such as the Airborne Visible/InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and a Science Data System for running COAL pipelines. COAL-FO will utilize recent funding obtained from a recently awarded NSF-funded XSEDE high performance computing (HPC) grant to further improve, validate and document COAL algorithms, execution runtime performance and geospatial output results.</p>
