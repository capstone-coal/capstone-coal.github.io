<h3>NASA Studies Volcanos and Coral Reefs from 65,000 feet (HyspIRI Hawaii, Part 1)</h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iKGeufqQqyc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This 6-minute, 8-second video shows how a NASA-led science team spent six weeks in January and February studying Hawaii's volcanoes and coral reefs using the Agency's ER-2 aircraft. The mission, called Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI), focused on observing coral reef health and volcano emissions and eruptions. Flying at 65,000 feet (19,800 meters), above 95 percent of Earth’s atmosphere, the ER-2 can closely replicate the data a future satellite could collect. Data from this mission will help in developing a NASA satellite to study natural hazards and ecosystems. NASA's ER-2 aircraft are operated by NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center and based at Hangar 703 in Palmdale, CA.</p>

<p>In this 2-minute, 37-second video, the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) flies high aboard NASA’s ER-2, using over 224 sensors to identify, measure, and monitor natural features of the Earth's surface and atmosphere based on reflective light from the sun. The instrument was recently used for the Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI) airborne preparatory mission, which focused on observing coral reef health and volcano emissions and eruptions around the Hawaiian Islands. Data from this mission will help develop a NASA satellite to study natural hazards and ecosystems. The Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument is developed and managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA. NASA’s ER-2 aircraft is managed and based at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center, Hangar 703 in Palmdale, CA.</p>

<p>Before a satellite is launched into orbit, scientists use instruments on NASA aircraft to calibrate, validate, and refine sensors that are part of current and future satellite payloads. In this 3-minute, 44-second video, data systems analyst Eric Fraim explains how an instrument called MASTER (MODIS Airborne ASTER Simulator) is being used to further develop Earth observing satellites. Flying on board NASA’s high-altitude ER-2, MASTER can detect thermal and visible spectral data as it scans air columns between the ground and the aircraft. The instrument was recently used for the Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI) airborne preparatory mission, which focused on observing coral reef health and volcano emissions and eruptions around the Hawaiian Islands. HyspIRI is a proposed NASA satellite concept that will study natural hazards and ecosystems. The MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator is a joint development involving the Airborne Sensor Facility at the Ames Research Center, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the EROS Data Center. NASA’s ER-2 aircraft is managed and based at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center, Hangar 703 in Palmdale, CA.</p>

<p>In this 5-minute, 5-second video, noxious sulfur dioxide gas and other pollutants emitted from Kilauea Volcano on the Island of Hawai`i react with oxygen and atmospheric moisture to produce volcanic smog (vog) and acid rain. These forms of pollution are recurrent health issues for the citizens of Hawaii. Vog can aggravate preexisting respiratory ailments and create conditions for acid rain, which damages crops and can leach lead into household water supplies. Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) at the summit of Kilauea closely monitor the amount and composition of gas emissions from the volcano's ongoing eruption. In February 2017, NASA scientists joined efforts with USGS, collecting data on the ground and from NASA’s high-altitude ER-2 aircraft as part of the Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI) airborne preparatory mission. Data from this mission will potentially help develop a NASA satellite to study natural hazards and ecosystems, including those affected by volcanic activity. The ER-2 aircraft is operated by NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center and based at Hangar 703 in Palmdale, CA.</p>

<h3>From the Ground Up: Building an Earth Science Satellite (HyspIRI Hawaii, Part 5)</h3>

<p>In this 5-minute, 52-second video, scientists from NASA and University of Hawaii, in partnership the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, teamed up in February 2017 to study the health of coral reefs located around the Hawaiian Islands for the Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI) airborne preparatory mission. Research divers and an autonomous kayak monitored coral color signatures from the ocean floor and surface, while NASA’s high-altitude ER-2 collected images of the same areas from a height of 70,000 ft. The data from these sources are being combined to better understand how coral reef ecosystems are responding to stressful conditions like warming ocean temperatures and water acidification. Data from this mission will potentially help develop a NASA satellite to study natural hazards and ecosystems all over the world. The ER-2 aircraft is operated by NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center and based at Hangar 703 in Palmdale, CA.</p>

<h3>Blowing Up Mountains: Destroying the Environment for Coal</h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvKe2LYy5pk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Massive corporations are blowing up mountains and creating environmental ruins in West Virginia. All this devastation, just to extract some coal. VICE News went to West Virginia to investigate mountain-top removal -- which a way of extracting coal from deposits under mountains. Instead of drilling into the mountain and sending men underground to take out the coal in the traditional way, they just take the whole top of a mountain off.</p>

<h3>AVIRIS-Faces of Earth</h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cg2B05ZCw18" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Faces of Earth is a 4-hour high-definition television series about the ever-changing planet we live on. The only thing constant on Earth is change and Faces of Earth examines this phenomenon through the eyes of those that know it best - geoscientists. Explosive volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods and even human beings contribute to the constant changes on the Earth's surface.
Explore how through time the forces of nature have continuously remade Earth - giving it many distinct faces through history, and many new ones into the future. Faces of Earth is shot in stunning high-definition with extensive aerials, cutting edge animations, and engaging interviews. Discover the compelling story of how the world's titanic forces play a key role in just about every aspect of life. Geoscientists note that by understanding Earth's constantly shifting surface, we can prepare for changes such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and floods to perhaps make adjustments for what lies ahead. Watch as Faces of Earth peels back the layers of Earth's geologic system to uncover a world of mystery.
Uncover the deep mysteries of our planet with top geologists in Faces Of Earth. Using state-of-the-art computer animation and stunning photography, these four in-depth, compelling programs explore how these forces shape the Earth and how, in turn, the Earth has shaped human evolution.</p>
